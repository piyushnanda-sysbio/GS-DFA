Make sure you have installed all the libraries used in this code: ppi_phos_integrated_analysis

1. Run the code by executing all the cells. Use 'Run all cells'
2. The input to the code are the reactions affected by PPINs and DPs along with the altered reactions as calculated from DFA
3. It should give the enrichment of PPINs and DPs affected reactions in DFA predicted affected reactions
